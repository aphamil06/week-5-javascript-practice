  <h1>Templates</h1>

  <p>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">Read more about
      templates here.</a>
  </p>

  <p>We know about variables. We know about Strings. We will now learn about But how to we put them together?</p>
  <p> We use backticks and ${ }. Have a look at an example</p>

  <h2>Example 1</h2>
  <p>Lets look at some variables and write them out in a string.</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let playerName;
      playerName = "John";
      document.write(`Hi, ${playerName}. Welcome to the game!`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let dinnerItem;
      dinnerItem = "Lasagna";
      document.write(`We are having ${dinnerItem}, tonight!`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let fruit;
      fruit = "strawberry";
      document.write(`It's ${fruit} season.`)
    </script>
  </p>

  <h2>Example 2</h2>
  <p>You can have as many variables as you want. You can even use numbers!</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let a;
      let b;
      let c;

      a = 12;
      b = 3;
      c = a + b;
      document.write(`${a} plus ${b} is equal to ${c}.`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      c = a * b;
      document.write(`${a} times ${b} is equal to ${c}`);
    </script>
  </p>

  <p>
    <script>
      a = 512;
      b = 64;
      c = a / b;
      document.write(`${a} divided by ${b} is equal to ${c}`);
    </script>
  </p>

  <h2>Try it!</h2>
  <p>Now you try it!</p>
  <p>Make at least 5 more examples of templates yourself.</p>

  <p>
  <script>
    let firstName;
    let lastName;
    let gender;

    firstName = "Joseph";
    lastName = "Johonson";
    age = 35;

    document.write(`Hello ${firstName}. Your last name is ${lastName}.  You are a ${gender} years old.`);
  </script>
  </p>

  <p>
    <script>
      let healthy;
      let dish;
      let drink;

      healthy = apples;
      dish = poboy;
      drink = Pepsi;

      document.write(`Today for lunch you will have a ${dish} with ${healthy} and a ${drink}.`)
    </script>
  </p>

  <p>
    <script>
      let NumberOfChairs;
      let NumberOfTables;
      let numberOfPeople;

      numberOfChairs = 40;
      numberOfTables = 8;
      numberOfPeople = 20;

      document.write(`We are expecting ${numberOfPeople} people to show up.  We need at least ${numberOfChairs} chairs and at least ${numberOfTables} tables.`);

      tables
    </script>
  </p>

  <p>
    <script>
      let business;
      let clients;
      let projects;

      business = "Pics or Us";
      clients = 40;
      projects = 50;

      document.write(`${business} is now working on ${projects} projects and accepting ${clients} new clients.`);
      
    </script>
  </p>

  <p>
    <script>
      let church;
      let membership;
      let vans;

      church = "Mount Olive Baptist Church";
      membership = 1500;
      vans = 4;

      document.write(`${church} currently has ${membership} members and ${vans} church vans.`);
    </script>
